## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
This program defines a function named factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer input by the user. The factorial is computed using a for loop that multiplies all integers from 1 up to the input number n, accumulating the product in a variable named result. The function returns this product as the factorial of the number. Finally, the program reads an integer from user input, calls the factorial function, and prints the computed factorial value. The factorial of a number n is mathematically defined as n!=1×2×⋯×n, with 0!=1 by definition.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program asks the user to input a number (which can be a float). It then uses Python’s built-in math module to compute three mathematical values for the input number:
The square root using math.sqrt().
The natural logarithm (log base e) using math.log().
The sine of the number (interpreted as radians) using math.sin().
Each computed value is displayed separately with descriptive print statements. This program leverages standard math library functions to perform common mathematical operations on user input, demonstrating usage of basic mathematical computations in Python.

## Read a File and Handle Errors 
This program tries to open and read a file named sample.txt, printing its contents line by line.
If the file does not exist, it gracefully displays an error message rather than crashing the application. 
This is accomplished using Python’s try-except structure, which specifically catches FileNotFoundError and other general exceptions, making the program reliable when handling file I/O tasks.

## Write and Append Data to a File
This program begins by taking user input and writing it to a file named output.txt. 
Next, it prompts the user for additional input, which is appended to the same file, preserving existing content. 
Finally, it reads and displays the entire file’s contents line by line. 
The step-by-step process demonstrates safe writing, appending, and reading techniques in Python, ensuring both user inputs are correctly stored and shown as intended.
